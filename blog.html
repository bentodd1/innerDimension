                      <p>Day 7

                          I decided to try Yoga at a new place near me.  It was slow poses led by a guy.  Overall, I was feeling good throughout having a mind body connection.  I was thinking about how this is where I am meant to be and I do not need to be in some fancy hip city or making a million dollars.  During Shavasana I began to realize how important connecting with my wife and soon to be kid was.  I thought about doing meditation with them.  I enjoyed the extended Shavasana with the body scan.  During the body scan it was nice to notice certain parts of my body pulsing.  Overall, I noticed having a teacher into Shivasana really enhances the yoga experience.
                          
                          Day 8 Yoga
                          I was feeling a little on edge before the class.  During the shavasna I definitely started to relax and feel better.  My face began to feel a little tingly and heart began to warm.  Afterwards, although nothing special happened I feel much better.
                          
                          Day 8 30 minute meditation
                          
                          At first it was hard to relax my mind.Then I did the Uji breathe and quickly became more relaxed and warm.  Eventually my breath slowed down and my mouth was closed.  But the Uji breathe helped me get there.  I was just there in the moment.  The main thing I realized is that goals do not matter and that enjoying the moment with others is what is important.  The destination not the journey is always but always true.  Planning everything is not being present.
                          
                          Day 9
                          
                          Hot Yoga.  I did the hot yoga and felt good for a while, but eventually felt overheated.  The shivasana at the end felt amazing, but did not last long.  The room was so hot I felt light headed.  After I cooled down I felt good and more present.  I do not think the hotness added anything and possibly detracted from the experience.  This could also depend on the individuals body as I was never some one who enjoyed sonnies either.
                          
                          Day 10
                          
                          15 minute silent meditation.  I don’t plan on doing hot yoga anymore as it made me agitated for much of the day.  This 15 minute meditation has me feeling instantly better.  I began to think about simple lessons from meditation.  1. Meditate more often and you will be happier. 2. Be in the moment.  3. Enjoy awesome moments with other people. 4. Connect with other people.
                          
                          Whenever I focus on my breathe I always feel myself about to drift off into another reality.
                          
                          Day 11 Yoga
                          
                          I love this yoga teacher.  I feel so relaxed and good when I do yoga with her.  Her focus is more on the mind body connection than the workout.  I feel good this whole practice.  While I am just focusing on my breathe and being in the moment my body and heart feel  warm.  I am starting to notice over these 2 weeks that I am happier.  Also, I am realizing my confidence seems to be shooting through the roof. The last thing I am noticing Is an openness to new ideas and new ways of thinking.  I feel like I can create my own reality.
                          
                          Day 12
                          
                          20 Minute Silent Meditation
                          
                          The first part of silent meditation my thoughts were thinking about daily issues.  After a while of focusing on my breathing I began to join the diving light.  Thats when I recognized that we are all part of the diving light.  Our ego just makes us forget about this connection.  It is almost as if this life is like a video game.  I do not really know what consciously went through my head after this but all I know is I felt very warm.  Today I had the thought that I want to boring back end processes into art.  I feel like the soul just wants to connect with others and make art but our physical bodies want and need resources.
                          
                          Day 13 Mind Body Soul Retreat
                          
                          I went to google and searched day retreat into google.  I ended booking a day retreat to something that was called mind body soul retreat.  The first part was a guided meditation.  This was very helpful and relaxing.  Afterwards we did Yoga and then took a break for lunch.  Finally after lunch there were discussions of jealousy, polyamory and oppression.  Although the discussions were somewhat interesting I did not really feel like it was the place for me.  I did meet some one who ran secular meditations twice a day though.
                          
                          Day 14
                          20 Minute Silent Meditation
                          
                          My mind was wondering quite a bit.  However I did get that warm feeling in my heart almost instantly.  The big thing I noticed is that I was feeling love and that my openness to change seemed happening.  To not be afraid of things changing.  Do not be afraid and close doors.
                          
                          Day 15 30 Minute silent Meditation
                          
                          The first 20 minutes or so of the meditation were pretty normal.  I started to just feel very relaxed and warm and began to feel the warmth going in and out of my breath.  The more I focussed on my breathe the better I felt.  At some point I started seeing a blue picture in front me that was shaking.  I soon realized that this is my reality and I can make it to whatever I want.  I decided to have sex with someone super sexy.  The sex felt real and amazing.  I feel like I had tapped into my subconscious mind which is why everything felt so real.  After having sex for a while.  I realized my perception was not limited to myself and so I switched my perception to being the girl.  As the girl I enjoyed the sex but not nearly as much as it was not my fantasy but I appreciated the guy being nice to me, but also wanted a relationship.  Then I switched my perception to my wife who was so I love with me and waiting for me to get home.  I then realized there was much more important things in life than sexual lust.  I began to see a tropical forest begin to grow at a rapid speed.  At that time the bell rang and I came out of trance.
                          
                          Day 16
                          20 minute silent meditation with Mom.  Felt relaxed and most importantly in the moment.  Reality is really just moment to moment thing.  I actually actually energized and excited to breathe.
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          
                          Day 17 10 minute meditation
                          
                          It is not the destination but the journey.  Feeling great.  Enjoy the moment atake it one step at a time
                          
                          Day 18
                          
                          30 minute silent meditation outside.  I began feeling really relaxed.  Eventually I started visualizing.  The visuals started in a dark place where there were many dead bodies.  It was a visually spectacular place on a pillar.  Eventually the dark place turned into a light which I started going towards and feeling warmer and warmer.  As I went into the spiraling light I began to loose a sense of reality.  Once there everything began to shape shift.  It was an amazing feature.  This made me realize that reality can be made with an instant and not worry about things being perfect.  To not take things so serious because they are constantly changing.  Some of the structures that were created were absolutely amazing.
                          
                          Day 19
                          
                          20 Minute Mediatiion.  My mind wandered quite bit.  The main thing I realized is I want lots of art and color in my life.  Including where I live.  I want to create an art game.  Maybe a psychedelic trip game.
                          
                          Day 20
                          
                          Yoga
                          
                          My face felt tingly. I felt great and full of fire
                          
                          Day 21
                          
                           30 Minute Silent Mediation
                          
                          The first part was figuring simple life takes like what I should eat.  I realized that simplifying the answer is usually the best.  To not make things more complicated than they need to be.  The second part I just listened to my breath felt a warm energy and relaxed and let my body feel great.  I feel war and full of love afterwards.  Excited to create art.
                          
                          Day 22 30 Minute Silent meditation
                          I started off realizing how important your physical state is to meditation.  I realized that it is harder to focus when you are focused on physical things that are bothering you. I began to drift to focus on my breath and relax as I did. I noticed my body and face relaxing.  Eventually I drifted into some subconscious state.  I don’t actually know what I was thinking, however I know I was not sleeping.  Afterwards I was feeling great.
                          
                          Day 24
                           Slow Yoga
                          
                          This mediation with the guy teacher was great.  I began to feel my energy pulsating.  When Vinassa happened I could feel my energy deeply.  It felt great and was a great experience.
                          
                          Day 25
                          
                          20 Minute silent meditation.  At first I kept thinking about the future and where things would go to.  Eventually I brought my awareness into my body.  I could feel the energy flowing form my ands to forehead back to hands.  This awareness got me away of trying to think go what was happening in the future.  I started to become more aware of where I was at the present moment.  Instead of what may be happening in the future.
                          
                          Day 26 
                          
                          Thoughts on reality
                          
                          If our life was a movie how would you make it.  I would want excitement and change.  I would want to be the hero in the movie.  Create something great travel around and have adventures.  How can I travel for work?  Talk to Kirby.  Find a new job.  Just travel.
                          
                          Day 27
                          
                          10 minute silent meditation.  Glad I finally got to meditate.  Feel much better.  Reality is like a movie we make.  We can chose to be the hero.  We can choose to have drama.  We can choose to be the villain.  If you are the hero then there must be something you are fighting against.  You must come up with a cause.  Who do I want to be?  Probably the hero, but maybe I want to live like a sitcom.  Need to keep meditating.
                          
                          Day 28 
                          
                          15 Minute silent meditation.  Meditation always makes me feel good.  It takes me away.  I should make sure to do it often.  I don’y know if it really answers questions.  I will try to morning meditations in the future.  Maybe I will try meditating with certain thoughts in my head, since w create reality.
                          
                          Day 29
                          
                          30 Minute Silent meditation
                          
                          My purpose is to bend reality and inspire others to bend reality.  You really can change things and motivate others to change things as well.  I love bending reality.
                          
                          Day 30 10 minute Silent Meditation
                          
                          I was stressed from the night before.  The meditation did put me in a better place even though I was stressed and tired.  I also realized I can fake it till you make it and try to be positive even when I do not feel good.
                          
                          Day 31 Yoga
                          
                          The yoga was great and I feel so much better afterwards.  My body need to stretch.  My face felt tingly afterwards.
                          
                          Day 32
                          30 Minute silent meditation
                          
                          After thinking for the first part I began to get into a trance.  I realized change required small steps.  Visual what I want to be and take small steps to get there.  I also kept thinking about sex.  I did began to visualize. I realized to take things much slower and enjoy the ride.  The other thing I realized was to be an inspiration to others.
                          
                          Day 33 
                          
                          1 Hour float
                          
                          I decided to pay for a 1 hour session.  It does make the body feel very relaxed.  The lesson that I felt like I learned is that I should make life rediculous.  If reality is not as it seems and we can write our story then we should make our story interesting.  It is what people love and our drawn to is interesting.  People are drawn to interesting even more than sex.  The other thing I realized is all the constraints society puts on our reality.  Get married and have kids go to college get a job.  We do not have to live through that story.
                          
                          Day 34 15 minute meditation with wife.
                          
                          Meditation with wife.   We mediated together and felt amazing.  Felt the peace and live.  The love felt stronger with more people.
                          
                          Day 35 
                          
                          Yoga .  I am getting stronger .  When I did the Yoga I felt happier but still energetic.   I feel excited and felt like I need to keep doing it.  During the shavasna I felt my energy change and become more relaxed.
                          Day 36
                          
                          20 Minute Silent meditation.  The main thing I got from this meditation is that I am being reborn.  When I started meditation after breaking up with Jackie I become reborn.  I am becoming a new person. I have Mentors Bryan and my Yoga Teacher.  I moved to Kansas City.  Sometimes for something new to begin something old needs to die.  My old self is dying so my new self can be born.  MY new self is yoga meditation.  It is bringing creativity to technology.  Being more mindful, learning the ins and outs of programming.  What is dying is the partying and the sleeping around.   That is dying.
                          
                          Day 37 Projections in the mind.
                          
                          At first my mind was constantly thinking of life goals and pleasures.  Then I started to analyze the projections in my mind and realize that they are what drive me to take action.  If you want to take different actions then you change the projections in your mind.  The things your mind drives you to do makes you not live in the now.  If you live in the moment then you can be happy in this moment, this means not being driven towards a mental projection.  Sometimes I think it is important to be driven towards things in order to survive, but many times it is not necessary and we can be happy right here right now.  It is quite strange how the mind works.  It is almost as if these mini hallucinations drive us to take action. This is how our brain thinks of the world.  If you can change these you can change a lot in your life.  Including eating to much and over indulging in other activities.
                          
                          Day 38
                          
                          10 Minute Silent Meditation
                          
                          I did the meditation after my work out.  Working out makes me feel so I alive .  I realized with my relationship with time I can be healthy.  I can not waste as much time looking at stuff randomly.  I can work out more often and eat healthier for lunch.  Just being healthy and living well is very enjoyable.  I really could change my relationship with time.
                          
                          Day 39
                          
                          Couples guided meditation.  I led my partner and I through a group guided meditation.  Through the mediation I could feel the love as we began to bond.  Eventually,  I stopped talking and we both fell into trance.  Afterwards, we felt great.
                          
                          Day 40 
                          
                          Yoga with Anette. Anette is my favorite yoga teacher.   I was thinking during Yoga about how interesting is the most important thing.  Interesting is being alive.  Being in the moment is alive.  Being different is alive.  If life was a painting I would want to be interesting not perfect.
                          
                          Day 41
                          
                          Put a dent in this reality.  Bring creativity to the masses.  Stop boredom.
                          
                          Day 42
                          
                          The main thing I realize is how amazing I feel and energized after doing just 15 minutes of meditation.  It really is beneficial for the mind.
                          
                          Day 42 Meditation with friend
                          
                          The amazing thing is how easy it is to change your energy.  You can change your energy into warm amazing energy.
                          
                          Day 43 Yoga
                          
                          Time flies so fast.
                          
                          Day 44
                          
                          Meditation feels so good.  It reminds me to take life easy and slow.
                          
                          Day 45
                          
                          Mediation makes me feel so light.  I should be more creative.  I feel super light.  As long as I keep producing content something good will come.  Visualizations can be powerful.  During the meditation for a brief period I completely lost track of what was going on.  Followed by feeling very light.
                          
                          Day 46
                          
                          Sleep stories for kids is a business idea.  Imagine myself being succeffull and happy in the future.  In charge of the team dynamic instead of vice versa.
                          
                          Day 47 Yin Yoga
                          
                          Creativity is what I really want in my life.  To be creating my own things and be in charge instead not being in charge.  Yoga and meditation helps my energy so much.  I realized that being unique is super important to me.  Selling a niche is real supply and demand if you don’t have a niche than it is just competition.  Mindfulness and technology.
                          
                          Day 48 20 minute silent meditation
                          
                          Doing the meditation helps to get you out of cycles.  It helps bring your brain into control and out of autopilot. It makes it so change is possible.
                          
                          Day 49

                          Day 50
                          
                          20 minute silent meditation.  After a while I could feel my body melt.  I could feel the vibrations in my head change.  I felt love.  I felt like I was joining witht eh love energy starting to melt into the love energy.  I could see amazing colors that reminded me of Indian colors.  I could feel the love energy.
                          
                          Day 51
                          
                          Yoga Yoga makes me feel relaxed in my body and live in the moment.  While in the moment it makes me question how I am spending my time with others.  To I become so goal focused that I forget to live in each others companies.  Maybe I need a balance.  Power comes from within.  Your happiness come from within you.
                          
                          Day 52 - Short meditation feeling lighter and better and deeper.
                          
                          Day 53 -  20 minute silent meditation.  I feel so much lighter so much less heavier so much clearer and so much calmer.  No insane realizations just feeling better.
                          
                          Day 54 - When I did meditation it made me realize happiness from the inside is the most important.  External achievements are not as important as you think.
                          
                          Day 55 - Buddhist meditation in Japanese festival.  The mediation made head feel more clear and I felt much more calm.  Much less stress out.
                          
                          Day 56 Meditation:  Things are cyclic.  You have to decide whether you want to be on a long cycle or a shot cycle.  Short cycle are things like drinking.  Long cycles are things like building a business or having a family.  When you meditate it gives you the oppurtuunuty to chose your thoughts and decisions.  Its ok to not focus on the breathe if you like what you are experiencing, but the breathe gives you the option to alter your reality with one quick thought.
                          
                          Day 57: Listening to sidhguru : so many good points.  Looking for a person to be perfect will never work.
                          
                          Day 58:  Yoga and the inner dimension.  I realize that my experience is completely different from day to day life than when I meditate.  Existence can completely shift.  I want to take things from my inner dimension and bring them to the real world.  I will call it things from the inner dimension
                          
                          Day 58:  
                          
                          A lot of happiness comes from within.  Life is a joy you have to look at it like that.  Sex and life is such a blessing.  Sex is the creation of life.  Pleasure seems like it is from out of this world.  It’s interesting thinking about my body as I do not normally realize how my feet feel or face feels as I normally not in the moment.  Our reality is created moment to my moment from our mind, mixed with emotions.   Visualizations create emotions and real experiences create emotions as well.
                          
                          Day 59:
                          
                          Creativity can be found within ourselves.  Each person has the ability to create.  We get pushed in society to believe certain things and follow certain paths, but our real inner nature is to create things.
                          
                          The awakening.  In our world it is easy to get caught up in lives others have planned out for us.  School wants to follow a certain path and listen to rules.  Companies want us to follow rules.  Religion wants us to follow certain rules.    All of these rules were made up by someone.  The truth is we can make our own decisions and make our own reality.  We don’t have to be followers.  We can be the creators of our own reality.  For me I recognize this when I slow down and step out of the day to day routine.  When I am truly in the moment and realize there are unlimited paths.
                          
                          Day 60
                          
                          Art and music are great because they help us to recognize the beauty that is around us.  It is always there, but we forget to recognize it.  Thank god for all the beauty.
                          
                          Day 61
                          
                          We are all moving so fast to go no where.  It is better to move with the universe than against it.  Meditation helps us slow to to the moment and enjoy our existence.  Instead of racing to get things done.
                          
                          Day 62
                          
                          Thinking we need to work hard and get a bunch of crap done is all made up in our heads.  We don’t have to do anything.
                          
                          Day 63
                          
                          Whats most important is enjoying time with the people you love and having amazing moments.Day 64
                          
                          Meditation Metting Shaman.  I went on a journey and shot into the clouds.  When I was there, there was all kinds of patterns and colors.  I felt lots of love and calm.  I then imagined holding my son my then became an adult and was amazing.  My daughter who was not born yet was an adult as well and was beautiful.  I wanted to cry.  Later on when we were meeting the shaman.  The shaman was showing me that I was a shaman and was showing me how to do it.  It was truly a magnificent experience.
                          
                          Day 65
                          
                          Sensory deprivation.   The first 10 minutes or so I was going through my own thoughts and things in my life.  Eventually I began to focus on my breathing.  I began relaxing and calming.  I warm sense began to come over me.  I began to think of 
                          
                          Day 67
                          
                          The purpose of life to expand god’s love and for others to experience god’s love.  Humans can experience more than other animals.  God’s love is this amazing universe.   The fact that we are alive is god’s love.  The fact that we feel is god’s love.  When people are healthy they experience god’s love.  Art is god’s love.  Rocks can experience god’s love, but animals and plants can experience it even more.  Whether there are other planets is unknown. What is known is god’s love is expanding.  It is growing.
                          
                          Day 68 Float Tank
                          
                          After being in the sensory deprivation for a while I began to feel my energy.  I knew my energy needed to be more confident.  I started to feel my energy becoming more confident and growing.  I know this is a needed step for me.  I began to feel myself as a king.  The next chapter in my life is to be a creator.  To be confident.  Later in the tank I began to realize that I controlled the experience.  Eventually I was launched into space by my own choice.  I began to see myself as light energy.  I could feel beings putting energy into me sort of like sexually.  I realized that sex is your energy connecting with someone else.  While this was happening I remember visualizing sex with my wife as energy and how the energy created from that was a child.  I felt like sex is an amazing transfer of energy into something great.  
                          
                          The purpose of life is be a creator to be part of the expanding energy.  IN doing so help others as well.
                          
                          Day 69  Float Tank
                          
                          When we create children we create a whole new reality.  We help the universe expand.  A new person is one of the best things for the entire universe.  There’s other ways we can make the universe expand like art etc.  children need to brought up well so there universe can expand and children can help expand the universe further. 
                          
                          One day when I was in a sensory deprivation tank, god sent me a message.  This message is that emptiness is the opposite of love.  Experiencing life is the amazing thing called love.  At one time nothing existed.  As time has gone by more things have existed. Because if this more love is felt.  Not all things experience things in the same way.  A rock experiences less than a plant a plant less than a chipmunk a chipmunk less than a dog and a dog less than a human.
                          
                          There is no such thing as enlightenment or ever lasting happiness because you already are love.  You can choose whether to feel it or not.  Sometimes it’s alright to chose not to feel it, as that will make when you choose it even better.
                          
                          Day 70 Group guided meditation
                          
                          Raising energy is always good.  I saw Rachel and a turtle.  I remember flying through a tunnel.  In that tunnel reality became like paint and colors.  I always connected with the ocean.  I remember swimming with a turtle but not as a spirit animal more as a partner or I was helping it.
                          
                          Day 71 group guided mediation
                          
                          Felt my sense of self start to fade away.  Then I could feel everyone’s energy in the room begin to connect.  Feminine masculine all the sill stuff faded away and we became one energy beaming up to the sky.  While beemed up into the sky I went to a planet that was night time.  I began riding a space bear through the valley.  We reached some point and brgan to communicate.  He explained to me that he is a part of me.  I felt so strong towards him and a strong sense of peace.  He began to explain to me he was here to help show me confidence.  We then joined and became one.  I then began spiraling through a black hole of energy and ended up on a pink planet looking at the sky.  I was feeling great.  I began feeling the energy of everyone in the room.  I wanted to share the great energy with everyone and started imagining touching everyone on the forehead spreading the warm energy.   I could feel everyone’s compassion in the room.
                          
                          Day 72 group guided meditation

                          Felt relaxed.  Thought a bunch about sex.  Sex is so powerful.  Realized not to control everything but I need to let go more often. Controlling things can be an illusion.  Just enjoy the journey the dance. Have fun.  Let go.

                           At one point i remember going up into the star and felt a rush.  When I was inside everything was white.  I remarried actually being a different person with a different body.  I was a woman a felt much lighter and like a weight had been lifted off me.  Then I remover tossing bouncy balls to other people.  The room was completely white.</p>

                      <p>I decided to do a 20 minute silent meditation today.  I remember thinking that it was really hard at the beginning.  I thought I was going to be able to figure my life purpose.  However, once I started focusing on my breathe the meditation became different again.  
                          I remember telling myself if a tree can be still then I can be still.  I consciously been to imagine myself as a still tree,  Eventually I fell into trance again.
                          I began visualizing again.  I remember blue people.  I also remember going on a roller coaster that was on a cliff at the edge of the ocean.  The view was breathtaking,  I remember thinking that I should have meditated for longer.  I also noticed in this case I was close to falling a sleep.  Overall I feel good.</p>

                      <p>I decided to go to a meditation Meetup.  The Meetup was Sahaja Yoga Meditation.  It was in a library.  I showed up and was the only one there.  There was a picture of some lady on a red table.  He also had a poster of a human showing a bunch of chakras.  It began with him explaining things to me as if it were a class.  There were some interesting rituals like saying, ‘Mama I ask you for forgiveness.’    The guy was super nice and super chill.  It was interesting getting a different perspective on things.  One we started doing the meditation I did began to feel good and relaxed.  My fingers felt tingly. The guy was a software engineer from India and we talked about work.  Really the meditation part was almost exactly the same as regular meditation mixed in with some rituals.  The only red flag for me was a picture of someone.  I want to be careful anytime I see people being ritualized.  It is easy to associate good feelings from a spiritual practice to a particular person.  This is done in Christianity as well as with many Eastern Religions.  I refuse to believe that some person is the savior or all knowing.  Anyways, I may go again just to see what it is about.</p>

                      <p>I decided to do another 30 minute silent meditation.  I went strait to the ujjayi I breathe.  Once I did my thoughts about work and being tired started to fade away.  I began visualizing again.  This was in a dark reddish scary place.  I wanted to quit but a voice in my head said you need to do this.  It turned out not to give me any anxiety althoughI would end up dying. I got eaten by some creature and then needs shot into my skin all over my body.  The needles were then pulled and my skin peeled off my body.  I felt no pain.  Then my muscles bled up into a million pieces and finally my spine blew up into even cut cookie cutter pieces.  Then something came over me.  I can control this.  So I did and I created a well lit glowing woman.  Who blessed everything she touched.  I was very attracted to her as well.  When she would touch me it would turn me on slightly.  As a matter of fact the whole meditation my mind would wonder to sex quite often.  I finally came out of the state of trance and found myself thinking about what I had just experienced.  It was like just normal thinking.  The thing that amazed me is that I could somewhat control the visualizations.  It reminded me of a dreams, where if you let go the dream unfolds but occasionally you will take control and guide the dream.  Then I decided to get back to the uni breathe.  After I did for a while I had one more short visualization.  A floating glowing flower.  After that I became distracted thinking about food and sex and even opening my eyes,  I noticed how much faster this 30 min session seemed compared to the last one.</p>

                      <p>I went to another yoga class.  This class was more focused on breathing and did not skimp on the vinyasa.  As I was meditating in the vinyasa at the end.  I did to to focus on the Ojai breathe.  As I did this My face began to tingle.  Then I started visualizing again.  I saw a volcano with light that was glowing.  Afterwards I felt very calm.  The yoga itself is a body meditation, the vinyasa at the end is a different world. Talked to the yoga teacher after she was ecstatic.  I am starting to believe there are other dimensions.  That we should live in this dimension but can learn from others.</p>

                  <p>I decided to do something much different.  I would sit in a chair in a pinch dark room for 30 minutes.  My experience was much different.  It seemed like whenever I would give into the moment I would start hallucinating.  My first hallucination was a long plant shooting into my head sending a light energy into my head.  My second hallucination was floating into space past planets and reaching a giant floating space creature with electric shocks.  The creature has many tentacles and fires one into my head.  It to sends electrical energy into my head.  The final hallucination was when my general thoughts about tv and video games finally switched over to being in the moment.  I found myself in a valley with many soft bushes.  It seemed like some kind of paradise.  I remember also thinking about sex.  I was constantly wanting to quit.  Whenever I accepted I would first relax and breath and feel less weight and then sometimes visualize.  I am not why my mind always wants to quit or if visualizing like this is a good thing.</p>

                    <p>I went to Yoga with my mom.  The Shavasana at the end was super short which was disappointing, since I wanted to understand meditation.  However I still feel good with lots of energy.  I have a warm feeling in my heart, which I do not get from other types of workouts.  The nice thing about yoga is it is a meditation for the body as well.  Nice and easy on the joints.  My psychology does not seem too much different as the class was pretty focused on the workout.  I do feel good and energized which is nice.  Next time I will try to do a longer meditation.  If I do yoga again it will have a longer Shavasana at the end.

                        I want to be with some one to join me on my spiritual journey.  I can create my own reality.</p>
